## Overview

This repository supplements the publication ["Automated AI-based Annotation Framework for 3D Object Detection from LiDAR Data in Industrial Areas"](https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2024-01-2999/) authored by: Gina Abdelhalim<sup>1</sup>, Kevin Simon<sup>1</sup>, Robert Bensch<sup>2</sup>, Sai Parimi<sup>2</sup> and Bilal Ahmed Qureshi<sup>2</sup>, affiliated with the [<sup>1</sup>Karlsruher Institut für Technologie (KIT)](www.kit.edu) and the [<sup>2</sup>ANavS GmbH](https://anavs.com/). It provides a LiDAR dataset for 3D Object Detection in warehouse environments, which is introduced in the paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first open source 3D point cloud dataset for industrial warehouse environments. The dataset itself is [hosted on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T0hDyBnyY22pwShCDjSK95hzItTqqLqf).

## Dataset Description

The dataset provided consists of consecutive 3D LiDAR scans (Velodyne Puck/ VLP-16) from a warehouse environment created from recordings on a moving platform. The dataset contains 3D bounding box annotations of the object classes listed below and illustrated in the figure above. The dataset generation corresponds to the description of the "Extended Pipeline" in section F of the paper. A LiDAR SLAM approach is used to create a dense optimized global 3D point cloud of a scene, followed by 3D bounding box annotation. Bounding box anntations are then automatically reprojected to each single LiDAR scan, which provides an efficient and consistent annotation of all scans.

**The dataset contains:**

| Type of Data  | Label | Color | Number of Samples | 
|---|---|---|---|
|**3D point cloud data**   | - | - | 3287 |
|**Annotations (3D bounding boxes) of five classes:**   | | | |
|- Vehicle Platform (Type 1) | "FTS"  | green | 600 |
|- Vehicle Platform (Type 2) | "ELFplusplus" | orange | 1248 |
|- Vehicle Platform (Type 3) | "CargoBike" | pink | 1205 |
|- Metal Box | "Box" | blue | 2847 |
|- Forklift | "ForkLift" | red | 481 |

Vehicle platforms of type 1, 2 and 3 are depicted in the figure above on the top left, bottom center and top right, respectively.

Each class represents a unique object type commonly encountered in warehouse and industrial environments. The current version does not include annotations for persons.

## Data Structure

The dataset is organized as follows:

```

        ├── 000000.bin
        ├── 000001.bin

where:

- **bin/**: contains the binary files (`.bin`) representing the raw 3D point cloud data
- **label/**: contains the annotation files (`.txt`) for each scan
- **tools/**: contains dataset tools (e.g. run `./tools/get_dataset_stats.sh`) 
- **vis/**: contains plots for visualization: top-down and perspective view plots of each LiDAR scan including bounding boxes
- **dense_point_cloud_SLAM.png**: rendering of the dense 3D point cloud of the scene used for 3D bounding box annotation
- **LICENSE**: provides dataset license information
- **README.md**: provides a description of the dataset
- **teaser.png**: teaser image from the paper

The files in the folders `bin`, `label` and `vis` have corresponding names. The image in `dense_point_cloud_SLAM.png` shows a rendering of the dense 3D point cloud of the scene that was generated by LiDAR SLAM and used for 3D bounding box annotation. Object classes are indicated by the bounding box colors as listed in the dataset description table above.

## Label File Format:
The txt label files contain the bounding box parameters of all objects annotated in the scan. Each row contains the parameters of a single bounding box and has the following format:

`class_name position_x_m position_y_m position_z_m scale_x_m scale_y_m scale_z_m yaw_angle_rad`

## Applications

The dataset can be used to investigate 3D object detection in warehouse environments based on 16-channel 3D LiDAR data. It can be used in various research and development scenarios, including but not limited to:

- Autonomous vehicle navigation in the industrial environment
- Object detection and classification
- Robotics and automation
- Industrial inspection and monitoring
